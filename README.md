LUG-WebIRC
======

Forked from the web-based IRC client Subway.  

This will be the webapp we'll use on lug.utdallas.edu.  It features a persistent connection ability and great basic IRC features.

Todo
------------
1. Continued UI overhaul
2. Change irc connection type to SSL
3. Fix so that it focuses on '#utdlug' chan instead of 'Status' on resume


History
-------

Subway is a combination of two projects that started independently
with a similar technology stack and similar aims:

- [subway-web](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-web) /
  [subway-server](https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway-server)
  by David Petersen
- [web-irc](https://github.com/akavlie/web-irc) by Aaron Kavlie

Its goals are twofold:
1) Become the best web-based IRC client available
2) Provide a really easy method of persistent IRC connections, available
   from any web browser

The inspiration for Subway was trying to watch a fellow programmer try
to explain how to set up screen/irssi to a non-technical person.
